Here's a Cats VS Dogs classifier ML model which is very simple and easy to understand.
I have used Dense,Conv2D,MaxPooling2D,Flatten,BatchNormalization,Dropout from keras layers to make the training process easy.
I recommend you to change the runtime hardware accelerator to T4 GPU to save your time on model fit epochs.
